    <p>We are not interested in exhibitions that rely on long explanations to function.</p>
    <p>Repetition is safer than failure, and therefore less interesting.</p>
    <p>We look at the work first, not the CV.</p>
    <p>We respond to artists, even when the answer is no.</p>
    <p>We do not charge application fees.</p>
    <p>We are bored by Western contemporary art’s default narratives.</p>
    <p>We don’t believe revolt needs to be loud, large, or monumental.</p>
    <p>We are suspicious of the word “museum-grade.”</p>
    <p>We value specificity over scale, intensity over polish, and risk over coherence.</p>
    <p>If a project could exist anywhere, it probably doesn’t belong here.</p>

      <h1>OPEN CALL</h1>
    <h2>MID APRIL – MID OCTOBER 2026</h2>

    <p>Dear Artist,</p>

    <p>Galleria Kuu-si is an <strong>artist- and curator-run, non-profit exhibition space</strong> in central Helsinki, just 500 meters from Kamppi Metro Station. Our compact 22.5 m² space has a <strong>street-facing window</strong> on Eerikinkatu, perfect for sharing your work with the public.</p>

    <p>We’re looking to create an <strong>art lab in the city</strong> — a place for fun, bold, diverse, and experimental projects. We provide <strong>basic supervision during open hours</strong>, help <strong>document and promote your show on social media</strong>, and offer <strong>curatorial support</strong> if needed. We do not take commissions on artwork sales.</p>

    <p>Artists are responsible for <strong>installation, de-installation, transport, insurance, and hosting the exhibition opening</strong>. We are happy to assist on site within our abilities.</p>

    <p>A <strong>two-week slot</strong> from mid-April to mid-October 2026 costs 450 euros, covering operational costs, including space rental, basic supervision, and social media promotion/documentation.</p>

     <h3>HOW TO APPLY</h3>
    <p>Submit <strong>ONE PDF</strong> in English (or Finnish if needed) to <strong>info@galleriakuusi.com</strong> including:</p>
    <ul>
         <li><strong>Page 1:</strong> Briefly tell us about yourself (one paragraph) and your preferred time period.</li>
        <li><strong>Page 2:</strong> A short description of your exhibition idea and medium (max one page).</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Page 3:</strong> Condensed CV (max two pages).</li
        <li><strong>Page 4:</strong> Portfolio.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Deadline:</strong> 23:59, March 8th, 2026</p>

  <p>Selected artists will be notified before April 1st. We are a very small team, so we can’t reply to every application individually.</p>

  <p>Also note that our next round of call is in <strong>June/July 2026</strong> :)</p>

  <p>Warmly,<br><strong>The Kuu-si Team</strong></p>

    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>Galleria Kuu-si is an artist-run exhibition space located at Eerikinkatu 33, Helsinki.</p>
    <p class="muted">The name of our space, <strong>Kuu-si</strong>, is inspired by W. Somerset Maugham's <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em>. It reflects the challenge many artists face: pursuing creative dreams while navigating the practical realities of everyday life.</p>
	<p>Our aim is to support the art community in building a sustainable art practice. We are seeking funding to make the space rent-free whenever possible. We also encourage artists to collaborate with our twin sister, the craft and artisan shop <strong>Honobono</strong>, located next door. This collaboration can include workshops or consignment of smaller art/design objects, helping artists create a more sustainable practice.</p>
